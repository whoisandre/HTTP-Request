# HTTP Request in C++

This is a simple C++ project that demonstrates how to make an HTTP GET request to a website using the [cpr](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr) library. It retrieves a response from a specified URL and displays the HTTP status code, headers, response body, and any error messages.

## Requirements

To build and run this project, you will need:

- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) or any other C++ IDE of your choice.
- [VCPKG](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for managing C++ library dependencies.
- [cpr library](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr) for making HTTP requests.

## Building and Running

1. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (e.g., CLion, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.).

2. Ensure that VCPKG is properly configured and that the necessary libraries are installed. You can use the VCPKG integration in your IDE if available.

3. Build and run the project using your chosen C++ IDE.
